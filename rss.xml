            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Antique paver bricks for sale</h1><p>I live in Oak Park, IL and frequently walk past the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio on Chicago Ave.  Starting in 2005, I noticed that they had a fairly large stack of old paver bricks at the back of their property.  I asked what they planned to do with them but they didn't have any answers.  They were in the process of putting in a new brick walkway with individually etched bricks honoring docents and donors.  I offered to buy the old pavers but they declined.  Over the next two years, I repeated my offer and one day they took me up on it.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/235c04ddec3e2b16c8cd0c5bd98aade4cb9b864a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
