            <description><![CDATA[<p>I live in Oak Park, IL and frequently walk past the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio on Chicago Ave.  Starting in 2005, I noticed that they had a fairly large stack of old paver bricks at the back of their property.  I asked what they planned to do with them but they didn't have any answers.  They were in the process of putting in a new brick walkway with individually etched bricks honoring docents and donors.  I offered to buy the old pavers but they declined.  Over the next two years, I repeated my offer and one day they took me up on it.  </p>]]></description>
