I live in Oak Park, IL and frequently walk past the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio on Chicago Ave.  Starting in 2005, I noticed that they had a fairly large stack of old paver bricks at the back of their property.  I asked what they planned to do with them but they didn't have any answers.  They were in the process of putting in a new brick walkway with individually etched bricks honoring docents and donors.  I offered to buy the old pavers but they declined.  Over the next two years, I repeated my offer and one day they took me up on it.  

Skip ahead ten years and now I am looking to move some things around.  I have approximately 3,500 0f these pavers available and am interested in selling them.  Moving 30,000 lbs of pavers in not an easy task but is manageable.  If you are interested in purchasing them, please contact me.
